# noVUEmber

For the 30 days of November, I'm writing Vue.js apps.

This idea was created by @zarahzachs

My goal is to practice and learn the framework, so initially, many of these apps will be very basic in design.

## Getting Started

I used [Vue CLI 3](https://cli.vuejs.org/)

Install:
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Create initial project:
```
vue init webpack noVUEmber
```

### My Setup

```
? Install vue-router? Yes
? Use ESLint to lint your code? Yes
? Pick an ESLint preset Airbnb
? Set up unit tests Yes
? Pick a test runner karma
? Setup e2e tests with Nightwatch? Yes
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
